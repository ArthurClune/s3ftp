s3ftp.py provides ftp like access to Amazon's s3.

You'll need boto to use this:

$ sudo easy_install boto

Original code by Dug Song (http://code.google.com/p/s3tools). This
version altered to use boto by Arthur Clune (arthur@honeynet.org.uk)

To get started, add a keys.py file with your access and secret keys
from http://aws.amazon.com/s3 (or stick them into your MacOS X
keychaini under s3.amazonaws.com as 'access' and 'secret').

Here's a sample keys.py

$ cat keys.py
ACCESS_KEY = "key here"
SECRET_KEY = "key here"

Then just use s3ftp.py as a ftp like service.

biber:code/local/s3tools 550: ./s3ftp.py                                                                                                    21:41:02
Connected to S3, bucket "arthur"
s3ftp> ls

Remote working directory: /
s3ftp> help
cd <path>                change remote directory
exit                     leave s3ftp
get <rpath> [lpath]      download a file
getdir <path>            recursively download a directory
help                     display this help text
lcd [path]               change local directory
lls                      display local directory listing
lpwd                     print local working directory
ls [path]                list files / directories. Options -l or -e
lsdir [path]             recursively list a directory tree
mkdir <path>             create a directory
put <lpath> [rpath]      upload file
putdir <path>            recursively upload a directory tree
pwd                      print working directory on remote machine
quit                     leave s3ftp
rm <path>                delete remote file
rmdir <path>             recursively remove a directory tree
setacl <acl> <path>      set acl: acl = public-read | public-read-write | private
version                  print version


Because s3ftp isn't a posix file system, all the directory related commands are
a thin skin over s3.
